**Project Walk Through:** [YouTube](https://youtu.be/v-XplVGRj58)

This project entailed an in-depth quantitative analysis of trading data from a hedge fund, with the primary objective of optimizing trading strategies to enhance financial gains. The initial stage of the project involved meticulous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), including the conversion of string-based time data into a more manageable format, handling missing values, and understanding the data distributions through histogram and scatter plot visualizations.

Moving further, we engineered specific financial features such as bid-ask spread percentage and bid volume fraction, giving us a more comprehensive view of the trading strategies and their effectiveness. This was followed by deploying linear regression models to predict key performance indicators such as entry slip percentage. Ultimately, the project provided valuable insights that can guide the modification of trading strategies for increased profitability. This work exemplifies strong data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling skills, demonstrating an ability to create quantifiable value in the finance and technology sectors.
